# Project Title
This project is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

# Getting Started
Since this portfolio website is used for demonstration purpose only, some information like my Twitter and Facebook pages and the latest Resume are not provided. I am trying to add coding experience to my Resume. It's inpropriate to provide the current Resume which is mostly medical translation related at this moment. They may be provided in the future.
